I'm 443eb9#C, a developer from China who is constantly striving for improvement.

<hr>

*What does my name actually mean?*
- 443eb9 is a random color I picked in Photoshop. I selected it from a plethora of colors, so I feel like we have a connection.
- #C is the reverse representation of C#, which was my favorite language when I was a Unity developer. Also, "#" acts like a separator.

Currently, Rust ðŸ¦€ is my favorite language. It runs fast, is memory-safe, and easy to write. Rust macros, enums, and iterators are the best things ever! C# is my second favorite language. It doesn't run as fast, but it's even easier to write.

I aspire to become a full-stack open-source game developer in the future. Besides coding, I'm also delving into painting and *planning* to learn cloth/building designing and music composition.
